All of u flop
Like fish on a dock
Ima go sip pino noir
Aiming the dart
Ima straight shooter
I'ma go tell u who u are
All of u flop
Like fish on a dock
Ima go sip pino noir
Aiming the dart
Ima straight shooter
I'ma go tell u who u are
Jordan Belford
Playing the stocks
Ima go buy me a yacht
Me & you
Me & her
Me & her best friend
No this shit just never end
No this shit just never end
No this shit just never end
Don't matter I got views though
Ima fly from jersey to Colorado

i ain't step foot in sak's baby my clothes thru the mail
Smoking weed in Colorado from the store top shelf
Treat my brothers like they family no lose ends
Need a ride or die that's really til the end
Like Romeo & Juliet
Where's my Juliet
Going thru my phone like she's tryna be upset
Just take my word for what it's worth
She want that vintage Prada skirt
Change ya world with a view
I get out my feels with a pill
Addy got me focused
Molly got me rolling
When we step in cameras rollin

All of u flop
Like fish on a dock
Ima go sip pino noir
Aiming the dart
Ima straight shooter
I'ma go tell u who u are
Jordan Belford
Playing the stocks
Ima go buy me a yacht
Me & you
Me & her
Me & her best friend
No this shit just never end
No this shit just never end
No this shit just never end
Don't matter I got views though
Ima fly from jersey to Colorado
