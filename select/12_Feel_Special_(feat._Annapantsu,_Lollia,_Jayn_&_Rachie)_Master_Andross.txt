There's just some days
Where I'm feeling as if i'm all on my own
When I don't feel like I'm not supposed to be with anyone
Nor everyone, kinda sad

When I feel down, you tell me
That I'm so special
So sentimental
you take my hand so tight and then you say-aye
Everything's alright
I go from nobody
Into your somebody
You bring the best out of me

You make me feel special
No matter what's getting thrown at me, I'm so good (I'm so good)
Don't care wha-at they say, it won't hurt my mood
'Cuz everything's fine when I know you're there (Know you're there)
That's what you do
Again, I feel special
'Cause when I speak I feel I'm not understood (Understood)
As if I'm there but people think I'm see through
But when I'm out there and you call my name (Call my name)
I feel loved, I feel so special

I'm blue, and want to run and hide
Go far, away from everyone
It's as if everything turned into gray
It's like colours are there but lost their meaning
I can't seem to move

And then I see you
So close before me
With a warm smile, holding out your hand
Everything's alright
I go from nobody
Into your somebody
You bring the best out of me

You make me feel special
No matter what's getting thrown at me, I'm so good (I'm so good)
Don't care wha-at they say, it won't hurt my mood
'Cuz everything's fine when I know you're there (Know you're there)
That's what you do
Again, I feel special
'Cause when I speak I feel I'm not understood (Understood)
As if I'm there but people think I'm see through
But when I'm out there and you call my name (Call my name)
I feel loved, I feel so special

Uh
You make everything alright
You can come right in
When it's pouring rain out side
In the dark you're the shining light
That's what you do
Even the darkest days turn to light like that
I owe it to you
Because

You make me feel special
No matter what's getting thrown at me, I'm so good
Don't care what you say, it won't hurt my mood
'cause everything's fine when I got you there
That's what you do
Again, I feel special
'Cause when I speak I feel im not understood (Understood)
As if I'm there but people think I'm see through
But when I'm out there and you call my name (Call my name)
I feel loved, I feel so special
